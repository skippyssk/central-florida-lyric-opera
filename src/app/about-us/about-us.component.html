      <p>
        Founded in <strong>1988</strong> by <strong>Bill Doherty</strong> and a
        dedicated group of opera lovers in the Central FL area, the
        <strong>Central Florida Light Opera (CFLO)</strong> was organized. The
        main focus of the company was to produce Gilbert & Sullivan operettas
        and other light opera works.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, by <strong>1991</strong> the singers had developed an interest
        and desire to perform grand opera and other musical concerts. This shift
        in focus allowed Mr. Doherty and the newly named
        <strong>Central Florida Lyric Opera</strong> a chance to do something
        more than present light opera productions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing how hard it was for singers just starting in their careers to
        receive opportunities to perform leading roles in opera, he wanted to
        provide not only a performance outlet for young singers, but also a
        fertile training ground where they could develop and hone their skills.
        Thus began the company's
        <strong>Resident Artist Training Program</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Singers in the program performed in the operatic productions and
        concerts, focusing on training and development through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Private voice lessons and coachings</li>
        <li>Group classes in language</li>
        <li>Stage movement and presentation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The company's productions were cast primarily from members of the
        Resident Artist Training Program. Professional singers from outside the
        company were only hired when there was not a member of the Training
        Program available to perform a certain role.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the years progressed so did the caliber of talent involved with the
        training program. Our Resident Artist Training Program began attracting
        singers from all over the <strong>United States and Europe</strong>.
        Many of our Resident Artists gained national and international attention
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Winning regional, national and international vocal competitions</li>
        <li>Singing with regional opera companies</li>
        <li>
          Performing leading roles both on Broadway and with national tours of
          Broadway productions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a long list of successful graduates.</p>

      <p>
        With increasing performance and study opportunities overseas, and a
        desire to offer performances of an operatic and non-operatic nature to
        its audiences, Maestro Doherty and members of the Board of Directors of
        Central Florida Lyric Opera decided to expand the company, establishing
        the <strong>International Opera Center of America</strong> - attracting
        performers, teachers, coaches and musicians from all over the United
        States and Europe and bringing its outstanding musical programs to
        audiences all over the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        And we're not finished growing! Our goal is to continue expanding our
        Resident Artist Training Program to offer more and more performance
        opportunities for our talented performers both here in the United States
        and abroad and to expand our audiences both locally and abroad.

      <h3>Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Repertoire workshop classes are generally held as noted on the master
        schedule. During production periods and Master Class workshop periods,
        private and group classes are sometimes suspended in lieu of
        rehearsals/workshops etc. Classwork consists of scene and aria
        preparation with preference given to upcoming production repertoire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singers should be prepared at each class with a warm-up selection
        followed by an aria or scene.
        <strong>All music should be memorized.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When classes have been suspended because of production rehearsals etc,
        all resident artists are encouraged to attend rehearsals even if you are
        not called for that rehearsal. A great deal of knowledge can be acquired
        by watching the rehearsal process.
      </p>

      <h3>Tuition</h3>
      <p>
        The Central Florida Lyric Opera's Training Programs are
        <strong>tuition-free</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singers are required to pay for their private lessons and coachings
        only. For members of the Resident Artist Training Program, lessons and
        coachings cost approximately <strong>$70-$100 per lesson</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the training programs are tuition-free, each member of the
        training program is responsible for donating
        <strong>20 hours per season</strong> to help in the office. These
        service hours may be done in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the administrative office (i.e. answering the phone, helping with
          mailings, running errands, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Helping with the set, costumes, or props.</li>
        <li>Other additional tasks as assigned by the staff.</li>
