      The Central Florida Lyric Opera Resident Artist Program offers emerging
      opera singers an unparalleled opportunity to develop their talents and
      launch their careers. Our comprehensive program includes:

      <li>Master classes with renowned artists and industry professionals</li>
      <li>Career development workshops and networking events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Resident Artist Training Program is tailored for talented,
      career-focused singers, seeking advanced training and experience in vocal
      arts. Participants attend classes in voice, stage presentation, and
      languages while also participating in all of IOCA's scheduled
      performances. Additionally, they have the opportunity to attend the annual
      IOCA Master Classes, led by nationally and internationally renowned
      teachers, coaches, and singers. Main stage productions are performed in
      their original languages, fully staged and costumed, with piano or small
      orchestral accompaniment. Furthermore, singers perform numerous excerpt
      concerts each semester. Operas are often double or triple-cast, providing
      ample opportunities for each member to study, learn, and perform full
      roles, gaining valuable experience.
